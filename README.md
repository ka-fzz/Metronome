# Just a simple metronome ðŸŽµ

This was my first project made in JavaScript a couple of months ago.
The drive to make this one was my guitar practice. I thought it would be cool to practice with my own metronome so here it is!

It was made following a tutorial by "Music and Coding" (https://www.youtube.com/@MusicandCoding).
