# Just a simple metronome ðŸŽµ

This was my first project made in JavaScript a couple of months ago.

### With this project I learned:
- How to manipulate the HTML elements by clicking and dragging using JavaScript.
- How to implement sounds on a webpage.
- How to make a accurate timer.
- The beloved callback functions.

The drive to make this one was my guitar practice. I thought it would be cool to practice with my own metronome so here it is!

It was made following a tutorial by "Music and Coding" (https://github.com/musicandcode) Thanks man!
